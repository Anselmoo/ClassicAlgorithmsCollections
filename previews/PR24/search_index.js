Thus, the BSA compares the target value to the value of the array's middle element. In the case of inequality, the half array-piece in which the target cannot be will be erased. Next, the search continues on the remaining half array-piece and starts taking the middle element to compare it to the target value. This procedure has to be continued until the target value is found. The search may have to be stopped with a remaining empty half array-piece; consequently, the target is not in the array.

The sorting procedure uses a linear fitting for finding the target position of the remaining search space in the array in more detail. The array's target position is calculated by the straight slope between the lowest and largest boundary of the remaining array and the lowest array position itself during each optimization cycle. If the target-position cannot be found, the array-space will be shrink for the lower or higher boundary region based on a comparison.

A specialty is that the HSA keeps the unsorted region in a heap data structure to find the largest element in each step more quickly. In more detail, in the first part of the HSA (while-loop), the largest value has to be found and set to position one. In the second part of the HSA (while-loop), the array's first and largest value has to be swap to the last index of the array, and the swapping-procedure starts again for a new interval n-1.

In the current implementation, a top-down implementation is used; however, a Bottom-up implementation can be used, too. In the top-down implementation, the MSA recursively splits the array into subarrays until the subarray size is < 2, merging those subarrays to produce a sorted array by using a new function merge. The back copying is blocked by alternating the direction of the merge with each recursion.
