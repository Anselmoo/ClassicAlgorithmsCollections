Find the total global maximum based on a comparsion between the intial vertex

the array-list (value).

    depth_first_search(graph::Dict{Int64,Array{Int64,1}}, start::Int64)

The depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm dedicated to traversing or searching for
tree or graph data structures. It starts at a specified tree root (start) for exploring
as far as possible at each branch. Afterthat the BFS starts automatically backtracking.
DFS is stack-based.
